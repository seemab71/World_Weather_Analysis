    "1. Create a folder called `Vacation_Search` to save all the files related with this deliverable.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. In the `Vacation_Search.ipynb` file, ensure that the dependencies and the Geoapify API key is imported correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From the `Weather_Database` folder you created in the \"Deliverable 1,\" import the `WeatherPy_Database.csv` file as a Pandas DataFrame named `city_data_df`.\n",

    "5. Write two input statements that prompt the user to enter their minimum and maximum temperature criteria for their vacation.\n",

Retrieve the latitude and longitude of each city and use the Geoapify API to find the nearest hotel based on the search parameters provided, then add the hotel name to the `hotel_df` DataFrame. If a hotel isn't found, set the hotel name as \"No hotel found\".\n",
